# pfsense-intel_NIC_drivers
Intel/HP [NC360T] dual-port gigabit ethernet drivers for pfSense box. These are packaged drivers for all OS's but FreeBSD and Linux flavors are in there too. Whole package was to large to upload so hopefully this is enough to get you going if you're having problems getting your pfSense box to recognize the NC360T dual port NIC on boot.
